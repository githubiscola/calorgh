this is an AHK autoclicker, you're going to need AHK to use this. a link for AHK can be found here: https://www.autohotkey.com/ and this is not mine i didn't create it (the video and the language), also if you need a tutorial for autohotkey's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcwSR4LWdNo.

by the way, this works on hotkeys basically you gotta press a button (which is Q) to engage the auto clicker and stop it with a button (ESC) and you can change the settings via notepad to change it to which ever button you look or whichever button is on your computer made by calonerr




**ABOUT USING ESC IT WILL COMPLETLY STOP THE APP SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RUN IT AGAIN**
